### NOTE ###
It has been a while since this has been maintained. If someone wants to make a pull request to work with current node/npm/gulp version I would love it! Last I tried, I got it working with npm 5.5.1, node v9.2.1, and gulp 3.9.1. There are also dependencies which Github tells me have vulnerabilities. I'm open to fixes!


## Description ##

* Game written in Node.js using WebSockets (socket.io) and HTML5 canvas.
* 0.1
* Authors:

*This assumes an elementary knowledge of node.js and how npm works with the package.json file* (basically what the "dependencies" are and how the "scripts" are called when the npm command is run in the same directory). It also assumes that node, npm, and git are installed.

The build files used are pretty simple, and are also documented well. In order to run the project follow the steps below. *First make sure node and npm are installed and up to date*

1.  **git clone** https://github.com/ryanp102694/tank-game.git
1.  **cd** tank-game
1.  **npm install**
1.  **npm start**
1.  *Browse to localhost:8080*
